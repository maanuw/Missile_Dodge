This is my first attempt at game developement where I explore foundational concepts of developing a game like flappy birds. I took reference from freecodecamp.org  through their 
Intro to game developement course/tutorial.

The game is to be updated with features such as:
1.Background Music           
2.Points System              
3.Highest Score Ranks              

At the current stage the game has the basic functionality of a single player where the user can move the Sprite in UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT directions.           
The Framerate can be adjusted according to the users system i.e for the smooth running of the loop of the game.
